### Context

Whenever you imagine an application for industry, you definitely get the idea of those very old and poorly organized screens. Yes, you figured it out! Fortunately, at TRACTIAN, we don't do that! We think a lot about usability, and it's no wonder that our slogan is to ‚Äúmake the Maintenance Manager's life easier‚Äù. Well-made screens are always in your head, so don't go easy!
